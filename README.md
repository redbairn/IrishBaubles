# :gift:IrishBaubles:gift:

IrishBaubles was made for a young entrepreneur in my area.  It was also my first project in my MSc in Computer Science course (Internet Technologies & Multimedia).  It wasn't my best of work but something that built on some basic knowledge from my undergraduates studies in Fine Art.  I worked with TextEdit back then and for my MSc I used Dreamweaver so this was a learning curve and great help for me.
